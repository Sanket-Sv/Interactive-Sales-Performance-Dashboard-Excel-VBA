# Interactive-Sales-Performance-Dashboard-Excel-VBA
ðŸ“– About This Project

In many organizations, sales data lives in endless spreadsheets â€” huge tables that are hard to read, harder to interpret, and even harder to act upon. I wanted to change that.

This project transforms raw sales data into an interactive, multi-city performance dashboard that anyone â€” from a sales manager to a senior executive â€” can use to make quick, confident decisions.

Built entirely in Microsoft Excel, this dashboard combines:

Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts for instant summarization

Conditional Formatting for easy KPI highlighting

VBA Macros for smooth navigation and automation

The result? A single, clickable interface that can:

Instantly switch between 8 cities (Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Nagpur, Patna, Pune, Ranchi, Surat)

Show four unique dashboard views per city:

Total Sales by Executive â€“ Whoâ€™s selling the most?

Alternate Team Sales â€“ Howâ€™s the other team performing?

Target Hit % â€“ Whoâ€™s smashing their goals?

Away from Target % â€“ Who needs more support?

With just a click, managers can identify top performers, find performance gaps, and analyze target achievement rates â€” without ever touching a filter menu.

This isnâ€™t just an Excel file â€” itâ€™s a decision-making tool. It replaces time-consuming manual reports with a dashboard thatâ€™s fast, visual, and accessible to everyone.

Whether for monthly reviews, quarterly performance checks, or strategic planning, this dashboard makes your sales story clear and your next steps obvious.
